# Escape-Room-Game-Scripts
BHASVIC A-Level Coursework scripts

For my A-Level computer science coursework, I was tasked with creating a project within 6 months.
Through conducting research on existing solutions and stakeholder surveys and interviews, I created a list of user requirements.
Using unity game engine, I created a game that met these requirements. This is a repository containing all the scripts used within
the game. Written in C# using OOP principles.
